#Collecting Dart Statistics


### The Issue

* Darts is an incredibly numerical sport.
* Darts is a very repetitve, structured sport.
* Commentators can often find themselves stating the obvious during matches or adding thin narratives to the game.
* The use of statistics in the game is currently limited to just 3 dart average and double hit/miss percentage.

### The Solution

* This is a prototype for the collection of statistics for darts.
* The collection is done via a simple point and click interface using javascript. The data is the exported in JSON format and can be analysed in R.

### The Business Model

* [Opta Sports](http://www.optasports.com/) is a company which has exploited this exact business model in other sports such as football and cricket and has very strong links with Sky. Could this model be copied for darts?
